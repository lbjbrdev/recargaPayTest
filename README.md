## Design choices

For the project, simple choices were used to build the UI, the project was styled using only the styled components library, and components from react native were used to build the components.
## Technologies and tools used:

The following tools were used to build the project:

- #### React Native (v0.76.3)

- #### Expo (v52.0.11)

- #### Expo Router (v4.0.9)

- #### Styled Components (v6.1.13)

- #### Json Server (v1.0.0)

- #### Axios (v1.7.8)

- #### Typescript (5.3.3)
## Requirements not met due to delivery time

It wasn't possible to integrate redux to manage the application's states, but I used the context API to control state management within the app
